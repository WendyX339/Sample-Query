# Customer & Program Data Analysis (SQL)

This repository contains SQL queries I used to clean and analyze customer and program data from a prior project. Due to data privacy policies, the original dataset is not shared. However, the queries demonstrate logic for deduplication, handling missing values, and calculating engagement KPIs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (JOINs, CASE, GROUP BY, Window Functions)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Business logic implementation
